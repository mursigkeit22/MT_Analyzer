# MT_Analyzer
MT_Analyzer is a comparison tool made specifically for translation agencies to check if translators used Google Translate while completing test tasks.

Save it on your machine (windows 64bit only) and launch it by double-clicking electron.exe file.
Place your google-translated text in the left column and add files you want to check to the right column. Files should be in .docx format.
MT_Analyzer will compare your documents with google-translated text and show the similarity percentage rate. Text similarities will be highlighted.
